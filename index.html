            <p class="section">When I was a youngster my biggest dreams were being a famous artiste or a doctor. Now it's all changed, now I want to be a "businesswoman". That naturally means I would like to be some global company's boss, handling busines with other companies, in other words making much money and getting more famous at the business world. That dream started when my grandma told me that I love money and I do much works to get money. I was a part stakeholder at selling my grandma's summer cottage, and it gave results, we sold it!.</p>
            <p class="section">I have always been a good seller, and I am good at what comes to selling or business. I could work in other countries too, it gives me potential to learn different cultures and ways to make business. Nowadays, cons of being a businesswoman, would be travelling. It might be pretty boring when you have done it too much. And of course, sitting on the office all days, calling and typing on the computer. Not forgetting stress. But pros of career gets me happy, much travelling from places to places and salary.</p>
